You can perform bulk delete operations on multiple documents in Compass
by using the :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal. Performing delete with
the :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal helps you visualize deletes 
to your data before you apply them.

About this Task
---------------

Deleting documents is a permanent action and cannot not be undone. 
Validate documents in the :guilabel:`Preview` of the 
:guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal before confirming the 
delete operation.

Before you Begin
----------------

The :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal is available starting
in Compass version ``1.5.X``. For instructions on updating or installing
the latest Compass version, see :ref:`download-install`. 

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  normal

   .. step:: Apply a query filter

      From the :guilabel:`Documents` tab, input a query into the 
      :guilabel:`Query bar`. The filter criteria of the query specified 
      applies to the documents in the :guilabel:`Delete Documents` 
      modal. If you need to delete all documents in a collection, 
      leave the :guilabel:`Query bar` blank.

   .. step:: Open the delete documents modal

      On the :guilabel:`Documents` tab, click the :icon-lg:`Trash` 
      :guilabel:`Delete` button to display the 
      :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal. The following 
      table summarizes the :abbr:`UI (User Interface)` of the modal:

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 40 60
         :header-rows: 1

         * - UI Element
           - Description

         * - :guilabel:`Query`
           - Any filter criteria specified on the 
             :guilabel:`Query Bar` applies to the 
             :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal.
             To update the :guilabel:`Query`, exit the 
             :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal and modify the 
             query in the :guilabel:`Query Bar`.
         * - :guilabel:`Export`
           - Prompts the :guilabel:`Export Delete Query To Language`
             modal. The :guilabel:`Export Delete Query To Language` 
             modal allows you to convert the delete query
             to a supported driver language.
         * - :guilabel:`Preview`
           - A preview of the documents that will be deletion.

   .. step:: (Optional) Export the :guilabel:`Delete`

      You can export the :guilabel:`Delete` query to a 
      supported driver language using the :guilabel:`Export` button on 
      the :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal. 

      a. On the :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal, click 
         :guilabel:`Export`. The 
         :guilabel:`Export Delete Query To Language` modal displays with
         the delete syntax populated under :guilabel:`My Delete Query`.

      #. Select a programming language by clicking the drop-down under 
         :guilabel:`Exported Delete Query`. You can convert your delete 
         syntax to: C#, Go, Java, Node, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust. The 
         converted delete syntax displays under the 
         :guilabel:`Exported Delete Query` header.

      #. (Optional) Include import statements 
         Click the :guilabel:`Include Import Statements` checkbox to 
         include the required import statements for the selected 
         programming language.

      #. Click the :icon-lg:`Copy` icon to copy the converted syntax.

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Close` button.

   .. step:: Delete your documents

      a. On the :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal, click 
         :guilabel:`Delete Documents`.
      #. Click the red :guilabel:`Delete Documents` button to confirm
         the operation.

      Compass applies the :guilabel:`Delete` to the documents
      within the :guilabel:`Filter` expression.

:ref:`sample_mflix dataset <sample-data>`.

the :guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal.

:guilabel:`Delete Documents` modal displays.
