You can perform bulk update operations on multiple documents in Compass.

A task page begins with a brief introduction summarizing the task, often called 
a short description. The short description briefly explains the task, and  
answers the following questions:

- "What is this task?"

- "What is it used for?"

- "Why do I care?"

This paragraph can include links out to important conceptual information
required for this task.

to the task. If task-related information is extensive, consider a bulleted list 
that contains brief descriptions of important concepts and links to deeper reading.

Steps
-----

These are the steps to complete the task. 

In some cases, we recomend that you use a stepped content approach. In others, 
a single statement and copyable command or syntax example.  In most cases, it's helpful 
to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It could be a 
brief description, code block, or screenshot. 

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Open the Bulk Update Modal

      From the :guilabel:`Documents` tab, click :guilabel:`Update`.

      The :guilabel:`Update Documents` modal displays.

      This modal displays:

      - Any filter criteria, this is the filter criteria from 
        the :guilabel:`Query Bar`.
      - The update statement, this is the ``$set`` command, that is applied
        to the documents in the collection.
      - A preview of documents after the update statement is applied.

   .. step:: Provide the update syntax 

      a. In the :guilabel:`Update` text field, provide the update 
         syntax.

      .. note::

            The number of documents affected by the update displays in 
            the top of the :guilabel:`Update Documents` modal in 
            parentheses.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Update Documents`.
         
         Compass applies the :guilabel:`Update` syntax to the documents
         within the filter criteria in the :guilabel:`` expression.

Example
-------

Optional.

In some cases, you can work through a specific example throughout the steps. 
In others, it is helpful to show a complete example at the end. In most cases, 
it's helpful to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It 
could be a brief description, code block, or screenshot.
