When using natural language querying, you may need to modify the 
query's maximum execution time by adjusting the :guilabel:`MAX TIME MS` 
query bar option. This option can help protect your cluster from excessivly
long query times on unindexed collections or large aggregation pipelines.
For details, see :ref:`query-bar-max-time-ms`.
