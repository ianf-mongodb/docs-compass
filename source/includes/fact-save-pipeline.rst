You can save a pipeline so that you can find it later. If you
load a saved pipeline, you can change it without
changing the original saved copy. You can also create a :ref:`view
<view-details>` from your pipeline results.

To save your pipeline:

1. Click the :guilabel:`Save` button at the top of the pipeline
   builder.

#. Enter a name for your pipeline.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.
