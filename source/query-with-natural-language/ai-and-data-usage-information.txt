Querying with natural language in Compass is powered by generative AI, 
and may give inaccurate responses. Please see our `Generative AI FAQ 
<https://dochub.mongodb.org/core/faq-ai-features>`__ 
for more information about AI in MongoDB products.

Third Party Providers
---------------------

This feature currently uses the `Azure OpenAI Service
<https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
hosted by Microsoft. 

How Your Data is Used
---------------------

When you query with natural language in Compass, the schema of the 
collection you are querying including collection name, field names, 
and types. 

The information that is sent is not shared with any other third 
parties or stored by the AI provider. We do not send database 
connection strings, credentials, or raw data from your databases. 

Disable Natural Language Querying
---------------------------------

Natural language querying in Compass is available if you have 
enabled the Compass :guilabel:`Use Generative AI` setting and logged 
into Atlas. If you no longer want to use the feature, you can ignore it 
and no data will be sent to generative AI models. If you would like to 
prevent usage of this feature entirely, you can turn it off in 
Compass :ref:`global configuration file <config-file>`.
