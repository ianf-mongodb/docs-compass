You can use MongoDB Compass to generate filter documents by using the 
natural language querying feature. Natural language querying can be used
to generate filter documents automatically based on prompts you provide 
to the MongoDB AI engine. Natural language querying is useful as a 
initial starting point help write MongoDB queries. 

For full details on Natural Language Querying, see 
:ref:`query-natural-language`.

   .. step:: Navigate to the Documents tab.

      .. note:: 
     
         The MongoDB AI engine can return both filter documents and 
         aggregations. If your prompt results in an aggregation, a popup
         appears directing you to the :guilabel:`Aggregations` tab.

   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Ask AI` button.
     
      The :guilabel:`Natural Language Query Bar` appears.

   .. step:: Type a natural language query for your collection.
     
      For example using the ``movies`` collection in the sample Mflix 
      data set, a natural language question could be:
      ``Which movies were released in 2000?``.

   .. step:: Press enter.
     
      A filter document is populated in the :guilabel:`Filter` bar.

   .. step:: Carefully examine the filter document.
     
      A filter document is populated in the :guilabel:`Filter` bar.

   .. step:: Click the :guilabel:`Find` button to execute the query.
     
      The results are populated in the documents view.
