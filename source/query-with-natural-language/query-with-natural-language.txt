You can use MongoDB Compass to generate filter queries and aggregations 
using natural language. Compass uses AI to generate filter queries based 
on prompts you provide. Querying with natural language can be a helpful 
starting point and assist you in learning to write MongoDB queries.

Use Cases
---------

You may want to use Compass natural language querying to:

- Ask plain text questions about your data.
- Create an initial query or aggregation pipeline that you can 
  modify to suit your requirements.
- Learn how to write complex queries with multiple aggregation stages.

Behavior
--------

- Compass natural language querying is available starting in version 
  ``1.40.x``.

- Natural language querying utilizes `Azure Open AI 
  <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service>`__ 
  as its current provider. Please note that this provider may be subject
  to change in future releases.

Details
-------

.. note::

   When you query your data using natural language in Compass, the text of 
   your prompts and details about your MongoDB schemas are sent to 
   Microsoft and OpenAI for processing. Your data is not stored on any 
   third party storage systems or used to train AI models. 

   This software uses generative artificial intelligence. It is 
   experimental and may give inaccurate results. Your use of this software
