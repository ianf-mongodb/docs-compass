You can use MongoDB Compass to generate filter queries and aggregations 
using natural language. Compass uses AI to generate filter queries based 
on prompts you provide. Querying with natural language can be a helpful 
starting point and assist you in learning to write MongoDB queries.

Use Cases
---------

You may want to use Compass natural language querying to:

- Ask plain text questions about your data.
- Generate an initial query or aggregation pipeline that you 
  can adapt to meet your data needs.
- Learn how to write complex queries with multiple 
  aggregation stages.

Behavior
--------

This section includes information you need to know before using a
feature. It can be as long or short as appropriate. Some examples of
technical details include:

- Compass natural language querying is available starting in version 1.x.

- Compass natural language querying uses Azure Open AI. This provider 
  is subject to change in future releases.

- Your data is not stored by any 3rd party providers. Field names, 
  database names, and field types are used by the Azure AI service to 
  produce queries.

your prompts and details about your MongoDB schemas are sent to 
Microsoft and OpenAI for processing. Your data is not stored on any 
third party storage systems or used to train AI models.
